# ABSTRACT

Loss, misuse, modification, or unauthorized access to sensitive information can adversely affect the privacy or welfare of an individual, trade secrets of a business or even the security and international relations of a nation depending on the level of sensitivity and nature of the information. So, we have designed a machine learning system that classifies the data in the images as sensitive or non-sensitive.
